Hypothesis tests for comparing  data from two pupulations
 

2) In a packing plant, a machine packs cartons with jars. It is supposed that a new machine will pack faster on the average than the machine currently used. To test that hypothesis, the times it takes each machine to pack ten cartons are recorded. The results , in seconds, are shown in the following table.

Old machine

42.1
41.3
42.4
43.2
41.8
41.0
41.8
42.8
42.3

New machine
42.7
43.8
42.5
43.1
44.0
43.6
43.3
43.5
41.7
44.1

Do the data provide sufficient evidence to conclude that, on the average, the new machine packs faster? Perform the required hypothesis test at the 5% level of significance.

3) A coin is flipped 50 times and resulted obtained were 28 H and 22 T. Is that coin fair?
